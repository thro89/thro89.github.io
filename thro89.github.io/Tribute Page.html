	<h2>Who is Saitama!?</h2>
	<article>
	<p>Saitama, &#40;base on a <a href="https://www.viz.com/one-punch-man">manga</a> charcater&#41; an average everyday hero from Z-City. Register to the Hero Association as B-Class Rank 7.
	He may look scrawny with no hair &#40;tell you why later&#41; but his devastating punch will surely blow you away.
	The reason why I choosen to make a page tribute to saitama beacuse, much of the comic books superhero becoming conceited with their speical ability and arogent when time passes. Saitama is different, he's an average hero who doing it fun of it. Unlike the other heros, that is doing it for a sense of purposes.</p>

	<h3>Saitama's Power</h3>
  <ul class="list">Saitama's power began with the consist on his daily regimen:
	<li>100 Push-Up</li>
	<li>100 Sit-up</li>
	<li>100 Squat</li>
	<li>10km Run</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The negative effect of this regimen is the excessive hair loss. With Saitama's immeasurable power, his battles victorys are only consist in a single strike. In all, every fights has ended in a single punch, which had become a dull fight.</p>
